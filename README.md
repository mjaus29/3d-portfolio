## üåê Live Site

üöÄ Here is a working live site: [portfolio3d.markaustria.com](https://portfolio3d.markaustria.com/)

## üìù Description

Welcome to my 3D Developer Portfolio project! This portfolio combines cutting-edge 3D visualization with effective presentation of professional skills and experience.

Traditional developer portfolios often lack visual impact and fail to demonstrate technical capabilities beyond static screenshots. I wanted to create a portfolio that would stand out to recruiters and clients while maintaining performance and accessibility across all devices.

This portfolio solves the problem of balancing impressive 3D elements with practical information display and smooth user experience, creating a memorable impression while still delivering essential information about skills, experience, and projects.

**Technologies Used:** React, Vite, Three.js, GSAP, Tailwind CSS, EmailJS

## ‚ú® Features

- **Interactive 3D Hero Section:** Detailed 3D room model with custom lighting and materials, including multiple light sources with different colors and intensities to create depth and atmosphere.
- **Animated Timeline Experience:** Dynamic work experience timeline that expands as users scroll, with cards that slide in from the left and content that fades in on the right.
- **Interactive Tech Stack Showcase:** Rotating 3D models for technology icons that users can interact with, allowing them to explore each technology from different angles.
- **Responsive Design:** Layouts that work well with 3D elements on both mobile and desktop devices.
- **Contact Form Integration:** Functional contact capabilities through EmailJS.
